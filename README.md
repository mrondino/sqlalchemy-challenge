# sqlalchemy-challenge

Project Title: sqlalchemy-challenge

Description: In this project, we are merging two datasets together and analysing the data based on certain fields. An analysis of the data is in the "Analysis" word file, please make sure to read this.

Getting Started: You will need to open the Jupyter Notebook code and run the engine to connect to SQL and the tables.

Code Source: I utilized the syntax from the 10-Advances-SQL/2/Activities/06-Stu_Reflecting_On_SQL class example to help connect to the engine and parse through the two tables. I utilized the "Xpert Learning Assistant" to assist on syntax for both of the Exploratory Analysis sections.

Author: The author for this project was me (Madeline Rondino)

Acknowledgements: Please reference "Code Source" above. I also utlized the "Xpert Learning Assistant" for recommendations on how to format this README file.
