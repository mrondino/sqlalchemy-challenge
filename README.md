# sqlalchemy-challenge

Project Title: sqlalchemy-challenge

Description: In this project, there is a SQL script that queries two tables. We are calling to that script with SQLAlchemy and then using Python to code.

Getting Started: You will need to open the Jupyter Notebook code and run the engine to connect to SQL and the tables.

Code Source: I utilized the syntax from the 10-Advances-SQL/2/Activities/06-Stu_Reflecting_On_SQL class example to help connect to the engine and parse through the two tables. I utilized the "Xpert Learning Assistant" to assist on syntax for both of the Exploratory Analysis sections.

Author: The author for this project was me (Madeline Rondino)

Acknowledgements: Please reference "Code Source" above. I also utlized the "Xpert Learning Assistant" for recommendations on how to format this README file.
